    "Conversion of the Torch Resnet50 model `torchvision.models.resnet50(pretrained=True)` to  ONNX was successful. The conversion of that ONNX model to CoreML failed.

One interpretation of such a result is that  the *Torch -> ONNX* conversion generates an ONNX model that is either not entirely correct, or not handled by the *ONNX->CoreML* conversion tools, or both.  However,  *more likely*  is that I introduced the error thru misunderstanding some part of the conversion procedure.  I'm still looking into this.\n",

See [40-Compare-torch-onnx-coreml](40-Compare-torch-onnx-coreml.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**95% Agreement - the \"Torch Family\"** - The predictions generated by the original Torch model, the intermediate ONNX model dervied from it, and the final (after repair) CoreML model - call these three together the *Torch Family*  - were very consistent. About 95% or more of the predictions agreed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*60% Agreement - the \"ONNX Family\"* - The \"Model Zoo\" ONNX model and its CoreML descendant - call these two the *\"ONNX Family\"* - generated modest agreement. A bit surprising that it was not higher.\n",

    "*53% Agreement* - between *Torch* and *ONNX* and *CoreML*\n",

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "  * Any conversion from Torch to CoreML will probably require some amount of CoreML \"model surgery\" followed by comprehensive testing.\n",
    "  * The converted model should behave very much like the Torch model, which is good news.\n"
